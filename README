kid
====

kid is an extensible bookmarklet command thing. It's similar to
Shortwave_ and `Quix`_.

.. _Shortwave: http://shortwaveapp.com
.. _Quix: http://quixapp.com



Usage
-----

1. Upload kid.php and point your browser to it.
2. Enter the URL to your shortcuts file.
3. Drag the bookmarklet onto your bookmarks bar.
4. Click bookmarklet.



Syntax
------

kid features the standard Shortwave/Quix tokens:

* ``%s`` - will be replaced by any arguments you provide.
* ``%d`` - the domain of the current site.
* ``%r`` - the full URL of the current site.
* ``%t`` - the title of the current page
* ``>`` - comment to the end of the line.

Plus some extras:

* ``%c`` - the full given command.
* ``%l`` - any highlighted text on the current page
* ``%{kittens}`` - a positional argument, to be optionally overridden.
* ``$ OPTION VALUE`` - a custom configuration option



Compatibility
-------------

kid *should* be able to read your Shortwave and Quix files, but obviously
neither will be able to parse the extra syntax kid provides.

If kid *can't* correctly parse one of these files, it's a bug.



Configuration
-------------

kid has the ability to dynamically change it's settings based on your
shortcuts file.

The syntax is as follows:

::

    $ CONFIGURATION_OPTION VALUE


That is a dollar sign (``$``) followed the configuration option you'd
like to set and the value you'd like to set it to.

Say you'd like to change the help trigger to a question mark. Place the
following line somewhere in your shortcuts file:

::

    $ HELP_TRIGGER ?




Examples
-----------

See examples.txt.



Notes
-----

* PHP must be compiled --with-curl
* JavaScript is required.
* When upgrading to a new version or changing settings, an update to your
  bookmarklet may be required.
* kid is not optimised. It's probably nowhere near the speed it could be.
