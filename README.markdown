# shrt
shrt is an implementation of [Shaun Inman](http://shauninman.com/)'s [Shortwave](http://shortwaveapp.com/), described thusly:

> an extensible quick-search and shortcut bookmark.

Yes, quite.


# Usage
Upload shrt.php, point your browser to it and follow the instructions. See [Shortwave](http://shortwaveapp.com/) for full syntax or shrts.txt for example usage.


# Todo
* Multiple/named arguments for search terms.


# Notes
* shrt can read your current Shortwave files, so no porting is necessary.
* When upgrading to a new version, one may need to update one's bookmarklet.
* shrt is pretty much untested and probably full of security holes.
